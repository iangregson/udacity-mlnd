### Proposal

The completed proposal document is included in the submission as `proposal.pdf`. The link to the review of the is [review.udacity.com/#!/reviews/1424503](https://review.udacity.com/#!/reviews/1424503).

**_NOTE_** - I had to change the project slightly from that described in the proposal. The proposal says the project will look to classify leads, opportunities and accounts but in the end the datasets for leads and accounts could not be made available to the standard from my company so instead the project focuses only on opportunities. I don't the project is degraded by this however, the only tangible difference is that less data is processed.

### Libraries

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook running the Python 3 kernel with the following libraries:

* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

### Datasets

The raw data for the project is located in the `/data` directory in a single csv file.

### Running the code

* Ensure Python 3 and all required libraries are installed
* Open `capstone_project_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells
